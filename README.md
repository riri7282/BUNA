# The Buna Ritual: A Speculative Design Probe

## Project Overview

The **Buna Ritual** is a multi-user web application designed as a **speculative design probe**. It transforms the mundane task of brewing coffee into a moment of **mandatory, collective synchronization** among users in a shared space.

This project critiques the fragmentation of attention and the loss of synchronous social moments in digitally mediated environments.

### The Core Provocation

If we want to reclaim genuine, shared communal time, must it be **technologically enforced**? What freedom must we sacrifice to achieve guaranteed presence?



### The Ritual Explained

The system elevates the simple act of brewing coffee into a structured ceremony:

1.  **Threshold:** The Ritual only begins when a minimum of **4 users** enroll on the platform.
2.  **Selection:** The system randomly selects one person as the **Brewer**.
3.  **Waiting State:** All non-brewers are placed in the passive **"Waiting State,"** visually represented by the breathing cosmic "Planet" screen, until the Brewer is ready.
4.  **Action & Synchronization:** The Brewer receives specific instructions and, upon completion, presses "I AM READY." This synchronizes the final notification to everyone instantly.
