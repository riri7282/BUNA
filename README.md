# ☕ The Buna Ritual: Your Speculative Coffee App

## 💡 The Core Idea

This project is a small, multiplayer web application built to explore a strange social question: **If we want real, shared community time, does technology need to *force* it?**

The **Buna Ritual** critiques our digitally fragmented lives by transforming the simple act of making coffee into a mandatory, synchronized ceremony.

## ✨ How the Ritual Works

The app uses strict rules to ensure a collective pause:

1.  **Enrollment:** When 4 people enroll, the ritual begins.
2.  **Selection:** The app randomly picks one person—the **Brewer**.
3.  **Synchronization:**
    * **Brewer:** Gets the instruction screen (and makes the coffee!).
    * **Everyone Else:** Must wait, watching the breathing "Planet" screen, until the Brewer is finished.
4.  **The Pause:** The UI is designed to feel ceremonial and cosmic, forcing users to step out of their individual timelines and share a single, silent moment of waiting.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

This project uses Node.js and Socket.IO.

1.  **Install:** `npm install express socket.io`
2.  **Start Server:** `node server.js`
3.  **Go to:** `http://localhost:3333` (Open **4 tabs** to see the full effect!)

*This artifact asks: Is enforced connection the cost of a synchronous digital society?*
